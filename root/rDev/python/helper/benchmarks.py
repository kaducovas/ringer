# Used for the data15_25ns tune, which had to use 50ns mc15 samples for the tuning.
# Since 25ns and 50ns have different efficiencies (due to the pileup), we 
# picked slightly looser operating points when tuning on the 50ns in order to have
# better efficiencies in the 25ns data. So this means these may not be ideal when
# tuning on data15_25ns or on mc15_25ns!!

# A previous iteration (too loose) used the same values for last two eta bins
